# 🚢 Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This project is a machine learning solution to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like class, age, gender, fare, and embarkation point.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Built a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset (handled null values, encoded categorical features)
- Trained the model and evaluated its accuracy
- Deployed using Flask and exposed with Ngrok for public access

## 📈 Model Accuracy

- Training Accuracy: ~80.89%
- Testing Accuracy: ~78.21%

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib,Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Pyngrok

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployed with Flask, and public access enabled via Ngrok. Users can input passenger details and get real-time predictions.
